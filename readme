This project presents "Tales of Turks," a procedurally generated 2D top-down
RPG game developed in Unity, highlighting the mythical creatures and stories of Turkish
mythology. The primary objective of the project is to enhance the gaming experience
by integrating artificial intelligence (A1) for NPC (Non-Playable Character) interactions
and procedural level design to increase replayability and user engagement. The game
utilizes the OpenAI API to create dynamic and responsive NPC interactions, ensuring
that each gameplay experience feels unique and immersive. The procedural level design
employs algorithms such as Random Walk and Dijkstra's algorithm to create unique
and challenging game environments for each playthrough. These algorithms enable
the creation of new level designs dynamically, ensuring that each level is unique and
challenging. Key success criteria include generating new levels in under five seconds,
receiving NPC responses within three seconds, and maintaining a high user satisfaction
rating based on gameplay difficulty and experience.
This project demonstrates the potential of combining A1 and procedural genera-
tion to create a compelling and dynamic gaming experience, emphasizing the cultural
heritage of Turkish mythology.
